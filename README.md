This software is meant to:
1) process data stored in different formats (JSON and CSV) and upload them in two different databases, in particular a graph and a relational database
2) query the databases simultaneously through predefined operations

To run the software you can use the script "test_final_software.py". If you have other data with the same structure of the ones inside this folder you can use them, simply by substuting the path specified in the run script.
